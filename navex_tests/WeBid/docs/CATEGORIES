Phpauction comes with a default and general categories

tree, but of course, you can personalize it as you need.



You have two ways to do that:

1. (SLOWER)

	Access the admin control panel, under Auxiliary Tables and click on the Categories Tables link.

	You may add/change/delete categories from this web-based management.

	This is ok if you don't have to make many changes to the original structure.

	

2. (FASTER)

To populate the categories tree from scratch, you must first edit categories.txt 
you find in the "admin" directory following the instructions below.  
 

	The structure of this file must be like the following:

	- all categories at the top most level must be entered like

	
		1@Art & Antiques

		1@Animals

	- all second level categories must be entered like

		2@Amateur Art

	  below the corresponding "father" and before the next " father" or next 

	  1@ category.

	  The sample above would be:

	  
		1@Art & Antiques

		2@Amateur Art

		1@Animals


	  This means Amateur Art is a subcategory of Art & Antiques.


	- If a 2@ category has "children" they must be entered like:

		3@Paintings

		3@Sculpture


	  Below the 2@ corresponding "father" and before other 2@ categories.

	  The sample above would become:

		1@Art & Antiques

		2@Amateur Art

		3@Paintings

		3@Sculpture
		1@Animals


	Once you have created or edited your categories.txt file, place it in the admin directory.

	The admin directory already contains a sample categories file corresponding

	to the default categories tree: save it somewhere if you want.

	Access the admin back-end, under Auxiliary Tables, click on Create 
    New Categories Tree.  
  
 If you have edited the categories.txt click on the Start >> button and your new categories will be created.
