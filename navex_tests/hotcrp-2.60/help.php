<li>Use <a href='#quicklinks'>quicklinks</a> on paper pages to navigate
 through search results.</li>
<li>On search results pages, <em>shift-click</em> the checkboxes to
 select paper ranges.</li>
</ul>
");
    _alternateRow("How to search", "
The default search box returns papers that match
<em>all</em> of the space-separated terms you enter.
To search for words that <em>start</em> with
a prefix, try “term*”.
To search for papers that match <em>some</em> of the terms,
type “term1 OR term2”.
To search for papers that <em>don’t</em> match a term,
try “-term”.  Or select
<a href='" . hoturl("search", "opt=1") . "'>Advanced search</a>
and use \"With <b>any</b> of the words\" and \"<b>Without</b> the words\".

<p>You can search in several paper classes, depending on your role in the
conference. Options include:</p>
<ul class='compact'>
<li><b>Submitted papers</b> &mdash; all submitted papers.</li>
<li><b>All papers</b> &mdash; all papers, including withdrawn and other non-submitted papers.</li>
<li><b>Your submissions</b> &mdash; papers for which you’re a contact.</li>
<li><b>Your reviews</b> &mdash; papers you’ve been assigned to review.</li>
<li><b>Your incomplete reviews</b> &mdash; papers you’ve been assigned to review, but haven’t submitted a review yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Search won’t show you information you aren’t supposed to see.  For example,
authors can only search their own submissions, and if the conference used
anonymous submission, then only the PC chairs can search by author.</p>

<p>By default, search examines paper titles, abstracts, and authors.
<a href='" . hoturl("search", "opt=1") . "'>Advanced search</a>
can search other fields, including authors/collaborators and reviewers.
Also, <b>keywords</b> search specific characteristics such as titles,
authors, reviewer names, and numbers of reviewers.  For example,
\"ti:foo\" means \"search for 'foo' in paper
titles\".  Keywords are listed in the
<a href='" . hoturl("help", "t=keywords") . "'>search keywords reference</a>.</p>");
    _alternateRow("Search results", "
Click on a paper number or title to jump to that paper.
Search matches are <span class='match'>highlighted</span> on paper screens,
which, for example, makes it easier to tell whether a conflict is real.
Once on a paper screen use <a href='#quicklinks'>quicklinks</a>
to navigate through the rest of the search matches.

<p>Underneath the paper list is the action area:</p>

<img src='" . hoturl_image("images/exsearchaction.png") . "' alt='[Search action area example]' /><br />

<p>Use the checkboxes to select some papers, then choose an action.
You can:</p>

<ul class='compact'>
<li>Download a <tt>.zip</tt> file with the selected papers.</li>
<li>Download all reviews for the selected papers.</li>
<li>Download tab-separated text files with authors, PC
 conflicts, review scores, and so forth (some options chairs only).</li>
<li>Add, remove, and define <a href='" . hoturl("help", "t=tags") . "'>tags</a>.</li>
<li>Assign reviewers and mark conflicts (chairs only).</li>
<li>Set decisions (chairs only).</li>
<li>Send mail to paper authors or reviewers (chairs only).</li>
</ul>

<p>Select papers one by one, in groups by <em>shift</em>-clicking on either end
of a <em>range</em> of checkboxes, or using the \"select all\" link.
For instance, the easiest way to tag a set of papers is
to enter their numbers in the search box, search, \"select all\", and add the
tag.</p>

PC members and administrators can attach tag names to papers.
Papers can have many tags, and you can invent new tags on the fly.
Tags are never shown to authors$conflictmsg1.
It’s easy to add and remove tags and to list all papers with a given tag,
and <em>ordered</em> tags preserve a particular paper order.
Tags also affect color highlighting in paper lists.

<p><em>Twiddle tags</em>, with names like “~tag”, are visible only
to their creators.  Tags with two twiddles, such as “~~tag”, are
visible only to PC chairs.  All other tags are visible to the entire PC.</p>");

    _alternateRow("Using tags", "
Here are some example ways to use tags.

<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid discussing low-ranked submissions at the PC meeting.</strong>
 Mark low-ranked submissions with tag “nodiscuss”, then ask the PC to
 <a href='" . hoturl("search", "q=%23nodiscuss") . "'>search for “#nodiscuss”</a>
 (<a href='" . hoturl("search", "q=tag:nodiscuss") . "'>“tag:nodiscuss”</a> also works).
 PC members can easily check the list for controversial papers they'd like to discuss despite their ranking.
 They can email the chairs about such papers, or, even easier, add a “discussanyway” tag.
 (You might make the “nodiscuss” tag chair-only so an evil PC member couldn’t add it to a high-ranked paper, but it’s usually better to trust the PC.)</li>

<li><strong>Mark controversial papers that would benefit from additional review.</strong>
 PC members could add the “controversy” tag when the current reviewers disagree.
 A <a href='" . hoturl("search", "q=%23controversy") . "'>search</a> shows where the PC thinks more review is needed.</li>

<li><strong>Mark PC-authored papers for extra scrutiny.</strong>
 First, <a href='" . hoturl("search", "t=s&amp;qt=au") . "'>search for PC members’ last names in author fields</a>.
 Check for accidental matches and select the papers with PC members as authors, then use the action area below the search list to add the tag “pcpaper”.
 A <a href='" . hoturl("search", "t=s&amp;qx=%23pcpaper") . "'>search</a> shows papers without PC authors.
 (Since PC members can see whether a paper is tagged “pcpaper”, you may want to delay defining the tag until just before the meeting.)</li>

<li><strong>Vote for papers.</strong>
 The chair can define special voting tags$votetags$setting.
 Each PC member is assigned an allotment of votes to distribute among papers.
 For instance, if “v” were a voting tag with an allotment of 10, then a PC member could assign 5 votes to a paper by adding the twiddle tag “~v#5”.
 The system automatically sums PC members’ votes into the public “v” tag.
 To search for papers by vote count, search for “<a href='" . hoturl("search", "t=s&amp;q=rorder:v") . "'>rorder:v</a>”. (<a href='" . hoturl("help", "t=votetags") . "'>Learn more</a>)</li>

you might search for “<a href='" . hoturl("search", "q=4+1+12+9") . "'>4 1 12

conflicted papers’ positions.  (Any given gap might or might not hold a

Chairs and system administrators can access any information stored in the
conference system, including reviewer identities for conflicted papers.
It is easiest to simply accept such conflicts as a fact of life. Chairs
who can’t handle conflicts fairly shouldn’t be chairs. However, HotCRP
does offer other mechanisms for conflicted reviews.

<p>The first step is to pick a PC member to manage the reviewing and
discussion process for the relevant papers. This PC member is called the
<em>paper manager</em>. Use the left-hand side of the
<a href='" . hoturl("assign") . "'>paper assignment pages</a> to enter paper managers. (You may need to
“Override conflicts” to access the assignment page.)</p>

<p>The presence of the paper manager changes conflicted administrators’
access rights. Normally, a conflicted administrator can easily override
their conflict. If a paper has a manager, however, conflict overrides are
not directly available: the administrator must remove the manager first.</p>

<p>Paper managers have full administrator privilege for the papers they
manage, so they can assign reviewers as normal. They cannot change
conference settings or use the auto-assignment or mail tools.</p>

<p>Paper managers who use normal assignments
will make life easy for reviewers. However, reviewer identities will
still be accessible via HotCRP logs, review counts, and mails, and
visible directly if the chair removes the manager. For additional privacy,
we recommend using <em>review tokens</em>, which are completely anonymous
review slots. To create a token, the manager (or a chair or administrator)
goes to an <a href='" . hoturl("assign") . "'>assignment page</a> and clicks on “Request review” without entering a name
or email address. This reports the token, a short string of letters and
numbers such as “9HDZYUB”. The manager can send this token to any system
user. Anyone who knows the token can sign in and enter it on the home page.
The system then lets them view the paper and anonymously modify the
corresponding review, which appears to be authored by “Jane
  Q. Public.” True reviewer identities will not appear in HotCRP’s database or its logs.
  For even more privacy, the trusted manager can send
  offline review forms via email, and upload the filled-out forms using
  review tokens; then even
  web server access logs store only the manager’s identity.</p>
